# Intelli RFID Reader — project instructions

Software for the Intelli RFID reader. Read this before changing anything; it captures decisions and
hardware behaviour that are not derivable from the code.

## Hardware

| Part | What it is |
|---|---|
| RFID module | Silion **SIM7500**, built on an Impinj **E710** Gen2 RF chip |
| Host | Raspberry Pi **Compute Module 4**, on board the reader — this runs the apps |
| Architecture | **aarch64** — use `libs/aarch64/libModuleAPIJni.so` |
| Serial port | **Confirmed `/dev/ttyAMA0`** on the CM4 bench rig (2026-08-27). A USB bridge gives `/dev/ttyUSB0` |
| Region | `RG_IN` is the intent (865–867 MHz Indian band) — but **the bench module refuses it**; see below |

The apps run **on the reader itself**, not on a PC talking to a remote reader.

## How this project is worked on

Two machines with two different roles. Know which one you are.

| Where | Reader attached | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Cowork on the Windows laptop** | No | System design, architecture decisions, first drafts of code |
| **Claude Code on the CM4** | Yes | Implementation, running against the real module, testing |

**Nothing designed on the laptop has been tested against hardware.** Everything a draft asserts about
module behaviour is inference from the vendor documentation and the demo sources — not observation.
Draft code is a proposal to be verified, not working code, however confident its comments sound.

Consequences, both directions:

- **On the CM4**: prefer running the thing over reasoning about it. You have the one resource the
  design sessions lack. When the module contradicts a draft, the module is right — fix the code, then
  record the correction in this file so the next draft starts from the truth rather than repeating
  the mistake.
- **On the laptop**: mark anything hardware-dependent as unverified rather than asserting it. Where a
  value can only come from a real site or a real module — settle windows, RSSI thresholds, antenna
  geometry — write a sensible default *and* say in a comment how to derive the real one.

What is worth writing back into this file after a CM4 session: corrected API signatures, module
quirks, the actual serial port, tuned configuration values, and anything that surprised you.

## Repository layout

Each app is its **own git repository**, remoted to AWS CodeCommit in `ap-south-1`. The project root
is a workspace, not a monorepo — the repo at this level tracks **documentation only** and explicitly
ignores `apps/`.

```
intelli-rfid-reader/            repo: intelli-rfid-reader — DOCS ONLY, ignores apps/
├── CLAUDE.md                       tracked here
├── CM4-BENCH-HANDOFF.md            tracked here
├── docs/                           tracked here
├── API-linux-java-v260721/     vendor SDK — NOT in git, copied separately
├── Hardware/                   datasheets — NOT in git
└── apps/                       ignored by the root repo; each app is its own repo
    ├── intelli-rfid-core/          shared library — repo: intelli-rfid-core
    ├── intelli-rfid-reader-test/   bench acceptance — repo: intelli-rfid-reader-test
    ├── intelli-rfid-tunnel/        warehouse portal — repo
    └── intelli-rfid-wayside/       trackside railway — repo
```

`git init` belongs inside each app directory. **Never create a repo spanning `apps/`** — the root
repo keeps that rule by ignoring `apps/` outright, so a stray `git add -A` at the root cannot
swallow an app. Nesting the app repos would need submodules and is not what this project does.

## The apps

| App | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `intelli-rfid-reader-test` | 8080 | A new reader arrives: is it good? Reads a few tags, writes a few tags, reports pass/fail |
| `intelli-rfid-tunnel` | 8081 | Warehouse entry/exit tunnel. A box of ~40 tagged articles passes through; a third-party app asks what was in it. Also commissions warehouse tags |
| `intelli-rfid-wayside` | 8082 | Trackside railway reader. A train passes; produce the consist |

`intelli-rfid-core` is the shared library underneath all three.

**The tunnel app is retail/warehouse. Only the wayside app is rail.** Do not conflate them.

## Stack

Java 17, Maven, Spring Boot 3.4.1. Spring Boot was chosen after confirming the CM4 has headroom —
Actuator health and metrics matter on a reader nobody can walk up to.

## Build order

The vendor jar is not on Maven Central and core is a local dependency, so order matters:

```bash
cd apps/intelli-rfid-core
./tools/install-vendor-jar.sh     # installs com.uhf:module-api-j:2.6.0721
mvn install
cd ../intelli-rfid-tunnel && mvn package
```

## The tag pipeline

Understand this before touching reader code.

```
vendor JNI thread            dispatcher thread          consumers
─────────────────            ─────────────────          ─────────
ReadListener.tagRead()
  copy TAGINFO → TagRead     ← structs are recycled
  RSSI filter
  dedup window
  queue.offer()        ───►  poll()
                             RecentTagBuffer
                             TagBroadcaster (SSE)
                             app subscribers  ───►  InventoryService / PassService
```

**The JNI callback thread must never block.** Anything slow there costs reads at the module. The
callback filters and offers; a single dispatcher thread does the fan-out. The queue is bounded
(8192) and drops oldest-first under overload, counting drops — surfaced on `/api/reader/status` and
`/actuator/health`.

## Vendor SDK facts

Confirmed from `API-linux-java-v260721/docs_en/doc_API_J_html/` — grep those files rather than
guessing at signatures.

- **`TAGINFO` structs are recycled** between callbacks. Copy before the read leaves the callback.
- **The byte-array argument to `WriteTagEpc` / `WriteTagData` / `GetTagData` is the access password**,
  not an EPC filter. Target one tag among several with `MTR_PARAM_TAG_FILTER`.
- `GetTagData(ant, bank, address, blkcnt, data, accesspasswd, timeout)` — 1 block = 2 bytes.
- `WriteTagData(ant, bank, address, data, datalen, accesspasswd, timeout)`.
- `WriteTagEpcEx(ant, epc, epclen, accesspwd, timeout)` — `epclen` must be even.
- `LockTag(ant, lockobjects, locktypes, accesspasswd, timeout)` — OR the `Lock_Obj` / `Lock_Type`
  enum values. Permanent lock types are irreversible.
- **Select filters are sticky module state.** A filter left set makes the reader look broken.
  `TagOperations.clearFilter()` exists for this; call it in a `finally`.
- **Ex10 fast mode and Impinj fast mode are mutually exclusive and both sticky.** `ReaderSession`
  clears the other on every mode change; skipping that gives a reader whose behaviour depends on
  what ran before it.
- **Single-tag operations cannot run during continuous inventory.** The `/api/tags/ops` endpoints
  stop and restart inventory around each call.
- **`new Reader()` triggers the JNI library load** via `JniModuleAPI`'s static initialiser. This is
  why `ReaderSession` creates its handle lazily inside `open()` — constructing it eagerly threw
  `UnsatisfiedLinkError` during Spring bean creation and killed the context before any retry logic
  could run, crash-looping a field unit instead of letting it report unhealthy. **Do not move it
  back into a field initialiser.**
- **The JNI library needs `-Djava.library.path`; `rfid.reader.native-lib-path` alone does not work.**
  `JniModuleAPI`'s static initialiser calls `System.loadLibrary("ModuleAPIJni")`, which searches only
  `java.library.path`. `NativeLibraryLoader`'s `System.load()` of the same `.so` by absolute path
  succeeds but does **not** satisfy it, so `new Reader()` still throws `UnsatisfiedLinkError` — 
  surfacing as an HTTP 500, not a 409. **Every launch command and systemd unit must pass
  `-Djava.library.path=/opt/intelli/lib`.** Verified on the CM4 2026-08-27.
- **Region is a firmware SKU limit, and the bench module is locked to `RG_EU3`.** Setting each
  `Region_Conf` and reading it back is the only way to find out: `MTR_PARAM_RF_SUPPORTEDREGIONS`
  returns `MT_INVALID_PARA`. On the bench SIM7500 every region except `RG_EU3` (8) — `RG_IN` (4) and
  plain `RG_EU` (2) included — is refused with `MT_CMD_FAILED_ERR / 0x10b FAULT_INVALID_REGION`.
  Under `RG_EU3` it hops 865.7/866.3/866.9/867.5 MHz, so the first three channels are inside the
  Indian band. `RG_IN` is region **4**, not 7 (7 is `RG_EU2`).
- **`ParamGet(MTR_PARAM_FREQUENCY_REGION, ...)` takes a `Region_Conf[]`, not an `int[]`** — the
  vendor doc says `int[1]` and is wrong; an `int[]` throws `ClassCastException` from inside
  `Reader.ParamGet`. `ParamSet` on the same parameter does accept a bare `Region_Conf`.
- **`TAGINFO.Frequency` is in kHz** (`865700` = 865.7 MHz). It is the practical way to discover a
  module's actual channel plan.
- **`GetHardwareDetails` reports `module=MODOULE_NONE`** (vendor's spelling) on a perfectly healthy
  module. Not an error.
- **`BackReadOption.ReadDuration` is the latency knob, because the module batches callbacks.** A
  tag is not reported when it is read — it is reported at the *end* of each read window. Measured on
  the SIM7500: carrier-on → first tag = **ReadDuration + ~14 ms**, linear across 50/100/200/400 ms
  (63.9 / 114.5 / 213.9 / 412.8 ms median). The irreducible floor is ~28 ms. **Below ~25 ms the
  window starts missing the tag** and latency becomes an erratic multiple of the window (at 5 ms:
  min 28 ms, max 284 ms). 50 ms is a good default: first tag ~64 ms, tightly grouped. Callback rate
  follows the same law — ~1000/ReadDuration per second (50 ms → 16/s measured).
- **Gen2 S2 plus a continuously-on carrier makes a static tag go silent after one read.** Measured:
  16.0 callbacks/s on S0 versus **0.1/s on S2**, same tag, same everything else. This is correct
  Gen2 behaviour — S2's inventoried flag persists while the tag is powered — but it means any
  bench test that leaves the carrier on and uses S2 looks like a broken reader. It is also the
  thing that makes the tunnel's carrier-off-between-boxes design necessary rather than merely
  thermally convenient. Use S0 for continuous-carrier bench work; S2 belongs with triggered RF.
- **Ex10 fast mode was 14× *slower* than NORMAL on a sparse population.** Measured with 2 tags:
  NORMAL 16.0 callbacks/s, `IsFastRead=true` **1.1/s**. Fast mode is designed for dense populations,
  so this may well invert with a real 40-article box — but it means **fast mode must not be assumed
  faster and must be measured against NORMAL on a real box before it is made the default.**
- **A lambda field initializer cannot read a blank final field** before the constructor assigns it —
  hence the method references (`this::handleTags`) for the vendor listeners.

## Domain rules that are easy to get wrong

**Tunnel — settle is measured from the last _new_ EPC, not the last read.** A box sitting in the
field re-reads its own tags forever, so "no reads for N ms" never fires while the box is present.
A minimum duration guards the other end so a session cannot close in the gap before the rest of the
box enters the field.

**Tunnel — `expectedTags` is what turns a tag count into a verifiable inventory.** Without it the
service can say the population settled, but not that nothing is missing. A `TIMED_OUT` session is
never trustworthy even if the count happens to match.

**Wayside — silence is measured from the last read**, unlike the tunnel. A train is a moving
population: each wagon enters and leaves the field, so silence genuinely means the train has gone.

**Wayside — `pass-gap-ms` must sit above the longest gap _within_ a train** (across a locomotive, a
brake van, or a rake of untagged wagons) **and below the shortest headway between trains.** Too low
splits one train into two consists; too high merges two trains.

**Wayside — wagons are keyed on decoded wagon id, not EPC**, so a wagon with a tag on each side
counts once. Ordering is by first sighting only; a later re-read must never move a wagon.

**Wayside — direction and speed refuse to guess.** `UNKNOWN` / `null` when the antenna geometry is
not configured or the evidence is split. A wrong direction on a consist is worse than an absent one.

**Decoding never fails a read.** If the wagon-id rule does not match an EPC, the raw EPC is used and
the sighting is marked `decoded: false`. Losing a wagon because its tag did not match a regex would
be far worse than showing a hex string.

## Conventions

- Framework-free code goes in `com.intelli.rfid.core`; anything Spring goes in
  `com.intelli.rfid.spring`. Core must stay usable from a plain CLI, so its Spring dependencies are
  `<optional>`.
- **Core's pom must keep `<parameters>true</parameters>` on the compiler plugin.** Core has no parent
  pom by design, so it does not inherit the flag from `spring-boot-starter-parent` the way the apps
  do. Without it, any `@RequestParam` / `@PathVariable` in core that omits an explicit name fails at
  *request* time with HTTP 400 ("parameter name information not available via reflection") — code
  that compiles and starts cleanly, then 400s on first use. Removing that config silently breaks
  four endpoints across all three apps.
- Every vendor `READER_ERR` is checked and wrapped in a `ReaderException` carrying the module's own
  detail string. Never discard a return code.
- `ReaderException` maps to HTTP **409**, not 500 — almost every one means "the reader is not in a
  state where it can do that", which is a state conflict, not a server bug.
- Config values that depend on a site (settle windows, RSSI thresholds, antenna geometry) get a
  comment saying how to tune them from real data, not just a default.

## Gotchas

- **Ask the operator to start and stop the apps.** Claude Code on the CM4 cannot reliably manage a
  long-running process: a backgrounded JVM gets killed at tool-call boundaries, and
  `pkill -f '<app-name>'` matches Claude's own wrapper shell and kills that instead (exit 144). Use
  `pgrep -x java` or the listening port to identify it. For diagnostics prefer a **one-shot Java
  program** compiled against the vendor jar — open, do the work, exit, all inside one tool call. That
  is how the first tag read was obtained. If a server really is needed, start it and drive it within
  a single command, or ask the operator to run it in their own terminal.
- **The tunnel app hard-fails startup if its spool directory is not writable.**
  `JsonlSpool.initialise()` throws `UncheckedIOException` out of the `InventoryService` constructor,
  which kills the Spring context — `AccessDeniedException: /var/lib/intelli` on a dev box. Create it
  first (`deploy/install.sh` does, as user `intelli`). Worth questioning against this project's own
  rule that a field unit should come up and report unhealthy rather than refuse to start: a spool
  that cannot be written is a degraded reader, not an unusable one.
- **Maven incremental compile goes stale.** After editing a core source file, `mvn install` can
  report success while apps still bundle the old class. Use `mvn clean install` on core after
  editing it. Verify with `javap -c -p -cp target/classes <Class>` when behaviour contradicts source.
- Site config lives in `/etc/intelli/<app>/application.yml` and overrides the packaged defaults.
- The service user must be in the `dialout` group or the app starts and then fails to open the
  serial port — which looks exactly like a reader fault.
